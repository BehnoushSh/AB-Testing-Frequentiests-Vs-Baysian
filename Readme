A/B testing allows to experiment with different app features, user interfaces, and engagement strategies.

Hereâ€™s how it typically works:
01 - Segmentation: Divide the user base into groups (e.g., control group vs. test group).
02 - Variants: Create different versions of the feature or UI element you want to test (e.g., different button colors, wording, or placement).
03 - Exposure: Show each variant to its respective segment of users.
04 - Measurement: Collect data on user behavior (e.g., retention, revenue, engagement) for each variant.

The role of analytics come into place mostly on the step 1 and 4.
