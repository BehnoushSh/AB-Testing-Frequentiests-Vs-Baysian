A/B testing allows to experiment with different app features, user interfaces, and engagement strategies.

Hereâ€™s how it typically works:
Segmentation: Divide the user base into groups (e.g., control group vs. test group).
Variants: Create different versions of the feature or UI element you want to test (e.g., different button colors, wording, or placement).
Exposure: Show each variant to its respective segment of users.
Measurement: Collect data on user behavior (e.g., retention, revenue, engagement) for each variant.
